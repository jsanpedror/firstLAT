		<div>Children imitate adults. Their correct utterances are reinforced when they get what they want or are praised.
</div>
		<div>Children make mistakes because they are working out and applying rules rather than imitating.

Language acquisition occurs through developmental milestones which are not affected by the kind of reinforcement a child gets.</div>
		<div>Limitations</div>
		<div>Behaviourist theory</div>
		<div>Central idea</div>
		<div>Innateness theory</div>
		<div>Chomsky did not study real children. His work his merely theoretical.

This theory was based upon children being exposed to language but it doesn’t consider children’s interaction with people around them 
</div>
		<div>A child's brain contains special language-learning mechanisms at birth.
</div>
		<div>It is hard to find clear links between language and intellect in older children.

Some children can learn to speak in spite of abnormal mental development.

Syntax does not seem to depend on intellectual growth. 
</div>
		<div>Cognitive theory</div>
		<div>Language is just one aspect of a child's overall intellectual development.
</div>
		<div>Interaction theory</div>
		<div>This theory emphasises the interaction between children and their care-givers.</div>
		<div>According to this theory a child will learn more quickly with frequent interaction however children in all cultures pass through the same stages in acquiring language.

 There are cultures in which adults do not adopt special ways of talking to children, so child directed speech may be useful but seems not to be essential.</div>
